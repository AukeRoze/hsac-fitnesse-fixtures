Examples and documentation of fixtures to be used in [[Slim][.FitNesse.UserGuide.WritingAcceptanceTests.SliM]] tests.

!contents -R2 -g -p -f -h

A single integration test (i.e. wiki page) can combine the usage to these fixtures either by defining separate tables for each, or by using the concept of [[libraries][.FitNesse.UserGuide.WritingAcceptanceTests.SliM.LibraryTable]].
Libraries allow a single script table to combine methods defined by multiple fixtures. For instance to have test using a single script that first places an online order using [[a browser][>BrowserTests]] and then checks the order's content in a back-end system with [[a SOAP call][>HttpTests]].   

!define TEST_SYSTEM {slim} 

We configure Slim to use our own 'interaction', to allow all calls from Slim to a fixture to be intercepted. This allows for 'aspect oriented' solutions to common features instead of having to put that in each fixture method.
!define slim.flags {-i nl.hsac.fitnesse.slim.interaction.InterceptingInteraction}
!note This is a temporary solution. Once a FitNesse release with https://github.com/unclebob/fitnesse/pull/724 is used, we can use the !-InteractionAwareFixture-! interface present there.
