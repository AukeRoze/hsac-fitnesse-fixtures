Compare Fixture helps to visualize the difference between strings. 
Showing differences does not actually test anything, it is intended to be used in conjunction with other tests to highlight why two values are not the same.

|script|compare fixture                                          |
|show  |difference between|Hello           |and|Hello sir        |
|show  |difference between|Hello madam     |and|Hello            |
|show  |difference between|Hello madam     |and|Hello sir        |
|show  |difference between|Hello dear madam|and|Hello madam      |
|show  |difference between|Hello madam     |and|!-Hello   madam-!|
|show  |difference between|                |and|                 |
|show  |difference between|!- -!           |and|                 |
|show  |difference between|Bye             |and|                 |
|show  |difference between                                       |!-Hello
sir



Greetings to you.

To actually test something we can count the number of 'diffs' between two values
|script|compare fixture                                                   |
|check |count differences between|Hello           |and|Hello sir        |1|
|check |count differences between|Hello madam     |and|Hello            |1|
|check |count differences between|Hello madam     |and|Hello sir        |2|
|check |count differences between|Hello dear madam|and|Hello madam      |1|
|check |count differences between|Hello madam     |and|!-Hello   madam-!|1|



Sometimes changes in whitespace are not interesting, these may be ignored when determining the difference.
!note Whitespace added were there was none before, or all whitespace removed between characters, is still considered a difference.

|script|compare fixture                                                              |
|show  |difference between (ignore whitespace)|Hello dear madam|and|Hello madam      |
|show  |difference between (ignore whitespace)|Hello madam     |and|!-Hello   madam-!|
|show  |difference between (ignore whitespace)                                       |!-Hello
sir



Greetings to you.
-!|and|!-Hello
madam 
Greetings to you.

|show|difference between (ignore whitespace)|!-ha	ha	-!|and|ha ha|

Counting the number of 'diffs' between two values can also ignore whitespace.

|check |count differences between (ignore whitespace)|Hello           |and|Hello sir        |1|
|check |count differences between (ignore whitespace)|Hello madam     |and|Hello            |1|
