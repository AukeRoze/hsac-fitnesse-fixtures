Compare Fixture helps to visualize the difference between strings. 
It does not actually test anything, it is intended to be used in conjunction with other fixtures to highlight why two values are not the same.

Sometimes changes in whitespace are not interesting, these may be ignored when determining the difference.
!note Whitespace added were there was none before, or all whitespace removed between characters, is still considered a difference.
