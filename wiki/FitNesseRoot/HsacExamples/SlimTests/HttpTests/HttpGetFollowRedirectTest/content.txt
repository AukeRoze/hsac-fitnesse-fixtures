First we do a 'normal' GET.

|script  |http test             |
|get from|http://www.hotmail.com|
|check   |response status  |200 |

Then we do the same call without following the redirect, allowing us to inspect that a redirect is sent and what the redirect location is.

|script  |http test                                                             |
|get from|http://www.hotmail.com|no redirect                                    |
|check   |response status       |301                                            |
|check   |response header       |Location|!-https://mail.live.com/default.aspx-!|
|show    |response                                                              |
