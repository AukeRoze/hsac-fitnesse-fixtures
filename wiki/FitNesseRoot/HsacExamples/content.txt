The hsac-fitnesse-fixtures project contains some Fitnesse fixture (base) classes and a baseline Fitnesse installation.
At the [[bottom of this page][HsacExamples#Symbols]] example usage of the symbols is shown. The fixtures are used in the children of this page.

The fixtures provided aim to assist in testing (SOAP) web services and web applications (using Selenium) minimizing
the amount of (custom) Java code needed to define tests.

!2 Baseline installation features

The baseline Fitnesse installation offers the following features:
 1. Ability to easily create a standalone (no JDK or Maven required) Fitnesse environment.
 2. Run Fitnesse tests on a build server, reporting the results in both JUnit XML format and HTML.
 3. Fitnesse installation for fixture developers containing:
  * the fixture base classes (and Selenium drivers from Chrome and Internet Explorer),
  * Maven classpath plugin (such that tests can use all dependencies from pom.xml),
  * HSAC's fitnesse-plugin to add additional Wiki features (random values, calculating relative dates, Slim scenarios without need to specify all parameters),
  * easy fixture debugging,

!3 1. To create the standalone Fitnesse installation:
Execute 'mvn clean test dependency:copy-dependencies', the standalone installation is present in the wiki directory (and can be distributed by just copying this).
This standalone installation can be started using 'java -jar fitnesse-standalone.jar' from the wiki directory.


!3 2. To run the tests on a build server:
Have the build server checkout the project and execute 'mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test'.
The result in JUnit XML results can be found in: target/failsafe-reports (most build servers will pick these up automatically)
The HTML results can be found in: target/fitnesse-results/<SuiteName>.html

The Fitnesse suite to run can be specified by changing the value of the suiteName variable in nl.hsac.fitnesse.fixture.FixtureDebugTest,
or (preferably) by adding an environment variable, called fitnesseSuiteToRun, specifying the suite to run to the build server's mvn execution.


!3 3. Fixture developer installation:
Import this project in your favorite Java IDE (with Maven support).

To start Fitnesse: have the IDE execute 'mvn compile exec:exec'. The port used by Fitnesse can be controlled by changing the fitnesse.port property's value in pom.xml.
Fitnesse will be available at !-http://localhost:<fitnesse.port>/-!

To debug a fixture used in a Fitnesse page: change suiteName variable to contain page name in nl.hsac.fitnesse.fixture.FixtureDebugTest, then just debug this test (with 'wiki' directory as working directory).
