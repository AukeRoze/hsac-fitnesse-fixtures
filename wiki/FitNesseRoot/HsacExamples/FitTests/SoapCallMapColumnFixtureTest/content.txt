By extending !-SoapCallMapColumnFixture-! a Fit test can easily make SOAP calls. The request to send is created using a Freemarker template, all input column's values can be used in template, without requiring Java fields or properties in the fixture class. Output columns (columns whose name ends on a '?') require Java methods to be defined, generally performing a XPath expression on the service's response.

This page calls a weather service, similar to [[Slim !-HttpPost-! using Freemarker example][.HsacExamples.SlimTests.HttpTests.HttpPost3UsingFreemarkerTemplateTest]]. On this page we use an instance of !-SymbolsFixture-! to configure the URL of the service to call. This is a best practice, allowing the url to be configured without changing Java code but not requiring it to be repeated for each table calling the same service. Normally the symbols fixture is placed on a !-SuiteSetup-! page, accessible to all tests in the suite.

|Symbols                                                 |
|key       |value                                        |
|weatherUrl|http://www.webservicex.com/globalweather.asmx|

|Get Weather                                                       |
|countryName|cityName                               |weatherResult?|
|Canada     |Vancouver International Air-Port, B. C.|              |

The Java code for the 'Get Weather' fixture is a single class: {{{
public class GetWeatherFixture extends SoapCallMapColumnFixture<XmlHttpResponse> {
    static {
        registerNs("wsX", "http://www.webserviceX.NET");
    }

    public GetWeatherFixture() {
        super(XmlHttpResponse.class);
        setTemplateName("samplePost.ftl.xml");
    }

    @Override
    protected XmlHttpResponse callService() {
        return callServiceImpl("weatherUrl", "http://www.webserviceX.NET/GetWeather");
    }

    public String weatherResult() {
        String result = getRawResponse().getXPath("//wsX:GetWeatherResult/text()");
        return xmlAsHtml(result);
    }
}}}

!2 Standard Methods

!-SoapCallMapColumnFixture-! offers a set of methods to retrieve information on the SOAP exchange. Any fixture derived from this fixture also has these methods, so output columns displaying this information may be added to all tables using these fixtures, without custom Java code. The table below shows some of this standard information in its output columns: the request sent, the time (in milliseconds) the call took, and the full response sent by the server.

|Get Weather                                                                                        |
|countryName|cityName                               |request?|responseTime?|response?|weatherResult?|
|Canada     |Vancouver International Air-Port, B. C.|        |             |         |              |

!2 Check Call
Sometimes testing a SOAP service requires more than a single call the test needs to validate more than the call's response. !-SoapCallMapColumnFixture-! has a feature for this, allowing a second call to be made to validate the outcome of the first. An example usage would be a call to retrieve an account's details, to validate whether the call to the service to create the account has worked.
To use this feature a couple of things need to be done: update the fixture class with some configuration logic to define how the 'check call' must be made, add a method that uses 'getRawCheckResponse()', and add a column to the test table in the wiki to call this method.

!3 Configure Check Call
To configure the check call one usually specifies which (Freemarker) template to use for the check call (the constructor is an obvious choice for a call to 'setCheckTemplateName()'). Furthermore one needs to override 'callCheckService()' to make the actual SOAP call to the check service. Usually this entails calling 'callCheckServiceImpl()', possibly after adding a result value from the original service call to the current row's values (for instance the id of the account created).

!3 Triggering the Check Call
Validating the check call gives the expected response is similar to checking the service's response. A method needs to be defined that extracts a value from the check call's response and the test table needs to be extended with an output column mapping to this method.
'''Please note:''' The check call is only executed when its response is needed (i.e. 'getRawCheckResponse()' is called), so if no output column refers to a method needing this response the call is not made.
