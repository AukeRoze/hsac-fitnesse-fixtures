!1 Symbol and array comparison
To use the symbol and array behavior, one must start by adding a $ to the end of the columnname.

!2 Compare result with symbol
This functionality was added when we wanted to compare a returning value with a value that was earlier returned in the same testpage. How to use this functionality is demonstrated with the use of the !-CompareValues-! fixture. However this will work for all fixtures extending the nl.hsac.fitnesse.fixture.fit.MapColumnFixture.

!3 Demonstration of comparing with symbol:

First store value1 and value2 in symbols so we can compare with them later.
|!-CompareValues-!                      |
|value1|value2|=value1?    |=value2?    |
|1     |2     |symbolValue1|symbolValue2|

Now compare new value1 and value2 with the values stored in symbolValue1 and symbolValue2.

|!-CompareValues-!                      |
|value1|value2|value1?$    |value2?$    |
|1     |2     |symbolValue1|symbolValue2|
Tip: to see how the output is in case of a failure, change value1 and/or value2.

!2 Compare result with an array
Functionality is added to compare the returning value of a column fixture with an array of values. The array of values can consist out of literal values, symbols or a combination of the two. If the array contains symbols, the symbols need to be prefixed with a $.  While the symbol comparison (discussed above) works for all fixtures extending from the nl.hsac.fitnesse.fixture.fit.MapColumnFixture, for comparing with array one need to implement a method that returns the array of values as a string, separated by a delimiter. For an example, see the asDelimiterSepList method of the !-CompareValuesFixture-! class.

!3 Demonstration of comparing with an array:

Compare value1 and value2 with values and symbols in an array.
|!-CompareValues-!|                                         |
|value1           |value2|asDelimiterSepList?$              |
|1                |2     |Array[1,2]                        |
|1                |2     |Array[$symbolValue1,$symbolValue2]|
|1                |2     |Array[$symbolValue1,2]            |
Tip: to see how the output is in case of a failure, change value1 and/or value2.

The default array separator is a comma. If you need another separator, ie // then you can specify this by using the ARRAY_SEPARATOR parameter.
|!-CompareValues-!|ARRAY_SEPARATOR=//                        |
|value1           |value2|asDelimiterSepList?$               |
|1                |2     |Array[$symbolValue1//$symbolValue2]|
